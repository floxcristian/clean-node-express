# A basic Express.js API following Clean Architecture principles

### Project anatomy

```
app
 └ lib                              → Application sources
    └ application                   → Application services layer
       └ security                   → Security tools interfaces (ex: AccessTokenManager.js, to generate and decode OAuth access token)
       └ use_cases                  → Application business rules
    └ domain                        → Enterprise core business layer such as domain model objects (Aggregates, Entities, Value Objects) and repository interfaces
    └ infrastructure                → Frameworks, drivers and tools such as Database, the Web Framework, mailing/logging/glue code etc.
       └ config                     → Application configuration files, modules and services
          └ service-locator.js      → Module that manage service implementations by environment
       └ orm                        → Database ORMs middleware (Sequelize for SQLite3 or PostgreSQL, Mongoose for MongoDB)
          └ mongoose                → Mongoose client and schemas
          └ sequelize               → Sequelize client and models
       └ repositories               → Implementation of domain repository interfaces
       └ security                   → Security tools implementations (ex: JwtAccessTokenManager)
       └ webserver                  → Hapi.js Web server configuration (server, routes, plugins, etc.)
          └ oauth                   → Hapi.js authentication strategies and schemas
          └ server.js               → Hapi.js server definition
    └ interfaces                    → Adapters and formatters for use cases and entities to external agency such as Database or the Web
       └ controllers                → Hapi.js route handlers
       └ routes                     → Hapi.js route definitions
       └ serializers                → Converter objects that transform outside objects (ex: HTTP request payload) to inside objects (ex: Use Case request object)
 └ node_modules (generated)         → NPM dependencies
 └ test                             → Source folder for unit or functional tests
 └ index.js                         → Main application entry point
